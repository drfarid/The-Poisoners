## Overview
You are Mithridates in exile and must scavenge the land for different poisons and test them on yourself. Be careful though, other characters are in the same position as you, and rather than test their poisons on themselves they might just test them on you to get your items and the cure. 

Enter different worlds and experience strange physical effects and fight mythical monsters in your hallucinatory poisoned states. Find the ultimate antidote by collecting all the rarest poisons before others do and become the Poison King.
